This assignment is built upon Prof. Sheaffers code. The monster_description now generates npc's and there is an object.cpp file that has a constructor that creates objects they both check if they are eligable to be created and then create eligable ones. The dungeon will generate at least 10 objects and then will also create monsters in the dungeon and they will have their specified descriptions. all the code is located in npc.cpp, descriptions.cpp, objects.cpp, and a tiny amount in dungeon.cpp. The code now displays all monsters with their first color and sets all their attributes accordingly. you can also see all the monsters and objects in color when using no fog. The game gets very hard with the monsters new speeds.
