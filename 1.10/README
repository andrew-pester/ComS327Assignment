This assignment is built upon Prof. Sheaffers code. The PC can now roam around the dungeon 
and find ranged weapons such as bows and wands. To start a ranged attack you must have a ranged weapon
equipped and then you must press 'r' then 'r' again will be a concentrated attack and 'c' will 
attack all enemies in a 3x3 area surrounding the point you choose you can also 
press 'esc' to stop the attack. You can move the cursor as you
normally do with things like teleporting. You can attack anywhere that the 
PC can see but you cannot damage yourself with your own attacks. To have the new weapons appear in 
game you may have to change your object_desc.txt in ./rlg327 with the one included the 
description files. Currently you can only hold either a wand or a bow and directed attacks 
do full damage and the AOE attack does 1/3 the normal damage per enemy. Most the code is located in io.cpp 
with slight changes to things like move.cpp to make it so ranged weapons don't get included
in the damage done for melee attacks and vice versa. Also some slight changes to things like pc.cpp to handle
holding either a wand or a bow.
