This assignment is built upon Prof. Sheaffers code. The following code still uses the make file to generate and link files but is now just a parser. It will get a file at $HOME/.rlg327/monster_desc.txt and read through it to create monster descriptions. iff the monster description is valid will it print the description to the console. This uses a lot of checks to make sure everything is valid such as begining and end tags and fields are only entered once for each monster. There are loops to make sure the color and abil are valid. All of the code is located in desc.cpp and desc.h. all rlg327 does is run the parser for the file currently as per the recommendation in the assignment description.
