This assignment is built upon Prof. Sheaffers code. The following code now has the abilities of being able to disable fog of war until the PC moves again and also teleport randomly or to a specified location. The code has all been converted to C++ and now uses classes for most things that we're previously structs except typically enum's. The PC and NPC's both inherit from the class Character. All of the code for fog of war and teleporting are located in pc.cpp and io.cpp and use just basic algorithms to see if the area was visited and is still withing the PC's sight. To teleport you must press g, which will lift the fog of war, followed by either r for randon teleporting or an arrow key to teleport to another area followed by another g press. The cursor for teleporting will only appear after moving it off the PC. Otherwise pressing g twice esentially teleports you where you are standing. Also changes to the terrain that you haven't witnessed in your 5x5 square will not appear until you revisit the area and monsters outside your 5x5 square do not appear on the map. The
