 This implementation of the rouge like game is built off of Prof. Sheaffers code. Now you have control of the pc and can use the number pad to move as well as y, k, u, l, n, j, b, and h. To move down or up a stair case you will press the respective < or > when the pc is on top of it and it will spawn you into a new dungeon. You can also use m to check what monsters are on the map and scroll up or down using the up and down arrows. To exit the menu you must press the esc key. While in normal play you can also press shift + q to quit the game and get a special message. The primary location of the code is in my file named io.c which handles everything. it handles the input using a switch case inside a do while loop. if m is pressed it will call gen_monster_list which creates a list of all the monsters in the dungeon which in turn calls the recursive function scroll_list which handles scrolling up and down in the list with a switch case incrementing or decrementing the start point of the monster list.
