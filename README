My implementation of the dungeon project is built off the code of Prof. Sheaffer 
and takes --save and --load switches as well as the short hand -s and -l for saving and loading.
When called with no parameters it will create a brand new dungeon with randomly generated dungeon
with a random number of rooms and corridors connecting them all together. There is also a 
switch --nummon or -n followed by either a number or more switches for creating a certain number of monsters.
so -n 12 will create a dungeon with 12 monsters while just -n will create a dungeon with 10 monsters spawning
into the various rooms in the dungeon. Theses monsters spawn with various abilities such as intelligence, 
telepathy, tunneling and erratic. These different attributes change the way the monsters act with intelligence
the monster will follow the shortest path and remember the last location of a pc. Telepathy allows monsters
to know exactly where the pc is. Tunneling allows monsters to walk through walls to get to the pc.
Erratic causes the monster to occasionally move in a random direction otherwise it will stand still.

p.s. sometimes does stuff most of the time has a segmentation fault and can't currently figure 
out why it does this. Sometimes it will go for multiple iterations and sometimes it only runs once even
if no monsters are close to the player. Also if a monster spawns next to the pc then it will interpert
that the monster moved and show a game over screen. I'm very confused as to why it doesn't work currently.
